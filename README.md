# cifar10 ðŸ˜”
Solving CIFAR10 without using conventional CNN approach. Based by this [paper](https://www-cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/papers/coatesng_nntot2012.pdf).

We use K-means features extraction and XGBoost model to achieve the accuracy of 0.6252.

Main notebook is `overview.ipynb`. Feel free to experiment and play with the model. 

### Results across different approaches. For more details please check the notebook.
